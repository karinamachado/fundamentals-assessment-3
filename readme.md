#Functions Self Assessment

### Recommended : Read Below

- Self assessments typically take 1 hour. This may take you longer, given the material that we have packed in. 

  **Do not be discouraged. This is a learning journey.**

  Complete as many exercises as you can, or do them to the best of your ability. The more you write down as you understand them at this point, the better you'll understand what you can work on.

- WARNING NO TESTS: As you can see, we haven't provided any tests. This is so that you can practice debugging without them. Copy and paste your code into your Chrome Console for a quick and easy way to test your code.

## Self-Grading Process

After you complete each prompt, assign a grade to each item in the above Grading Outline, using this Grading Scale:

### Self-Assessment Grading Scale:

Qualitative grade | Meaning
---|---
Complete             | You believe your solution to be fully complete and meeting the specified requirements.
Mostly complete      | Your solution is well on its way to being complete, but you ran out of time or can't remember exactly how to do *one* particular aspect. You believe anyone who understands the problem well would endorse your solution as the right one, and know pretty clearly how to finish up any last touches.
Significant progress | You have the right idea and were heading in a good direction. Covers everything between Mostly Complete and Attempted.
Attempted            | You were very challenged by the prompt and had trouble making any significant progress on the problem, but wrote at least one meaningful line of code that appears to be a genuine attempt.
Not attempted        | Whether you've thought much about the problem or not, you have no lines of code to show for the problem. (Note, you should avoid ever getting into a situation where this is the grade you'd give yourself. Make a passing attempt at each problem before going back to complete any one problem.)

#### Example Submission:

Objects: COMPLETE  
Arrays: ATTEMPTED  
Functions: SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS  

## Submitting Solutions

**VERY IMPORTANT: Before submitting your solutions, find and fix all syntax errors**

Solutions are submitted via pushing your code to your OWN FORKED repository. We will take it from there.
