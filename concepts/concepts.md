Answer each question below in your own words and be as thorough as possible.
In addition to answering these questions and completing the other exercises, pushing your self-assessments to github is also an assessment in itself. By now you should know how to fork, clone, and ultimately push the repo using your command line (terminal) interface.
* [ ] Did you fork, clone, and push this repo?

-

* [ ] What are the two types of for loops that we have used in the course?
	* [ ] When would you use each type?

* [ ] How would you access an element in an array?

* [ ] What is the difference between "=" and "==="?

* [ ] How many times will "Hello World" print in this loop? Justify your reasoning.
```Javascript
for ( var i = 0; i < 10; i++ ){
	var string = "Hello World";
}
console.log("Hello World")
```

* [ ] What's the difference between forking a repo and cloning a repo?

* [ ] What is a conditional? Provide an example as well.

* [ ] Given the following loop :
```Javascript
for (var key in myObj){
	//code here
}
```
What does "key" represent? Is this something you can rename? If so, to what? If not, why not?

* [ ] How do you execute the code in a function? For example, how do I get this function to execute?
```Javascript
var func = function(){
	console.log("function executed");
}
```

* [ ] How many arguments can a function take in?

* [ ] What is the difference between "arguments" and "parameters"?

* [ ] "Not all properties of an object are methods, but all methods are properties." True or false? Justify your reasoning (you may use code to do so).

* [ ] What is an anonymous function? What is the opposite of an anonymous function?
